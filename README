Packages to import
    - os
    - openpyxl (to open excel worksheets)
    - webbrowser (to open links from worksheets)
    "os" is imported to check if operating system is iOS. If it's iOS, run AppleScript via Python

Audio package to install
    - BlackHole virtual audio driver (https://github.com/ExistentialAudio/BlackHole)
    Without a virtual audio driver, you can only record audio through built-in microphone instead of the internal sound system
    Therefore this is mandatory to install

Prior to recording
    - Go to "Sound" in System Settings, and change both Output and Input devices to Blackhole 2ch
    - Your speakers won't produce any sound, this is ok
    - Run the Python script, and turn volume all the way up
    - Once recording is finished, turn down the volume first, then go back to "Sound" in System Settings to switch rever both Output and Input devices
