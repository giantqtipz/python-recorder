Packages to import and/or import
    - os (to access system hardware devices such as the screen, and audio drivers)
    - openpyxl (to open excel worksheets)
    - ffmpeg (to initiate screen recording, and convert file into usable/viewable format)
    "os" is imported to check if operating system is iOS. If it's iOS, run AppleScript via Python

    - selenium (for webscraping via Chrome)
    - Chrome driver (to allow selenium to automate web scraping via Chrome) https://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/index.html

Audio package to install
    - BlackHole virtual audio driver (https://github.com/ExistentialAudio/BlackHole)
    Without a virtual audio driver, you can only record audio through built-in microphone instead of the internal sound system
    Therefore this is mandatory to install

Prior to recording
    - Go to "Sound" in System Settings, and change both Output and Input devices to Blackhole 2ch
    - Your speakers won't produce any sound, this is ok
    - Run the Python script, and turn volume all the way up
    - Once recording is finished, turn down the volume first, then go back to "Sound" in System Settings to switch rever both Output and Input devices
